# Astronomy FOV calculator  

An app for calculating and visualizing the **true field-of-view** of celestial objects based on your current astronomy setup (telescope, eyepiece and/or camera). The application is loosely based on the [astronomy.tools](https://astronomy.tools/calculators/field_of_view/) web service.
