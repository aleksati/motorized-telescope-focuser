# Astronomy FOV calculator  

A custom app designed to calculate and visualize the true field-of-view of celestial objects (just planets, for now) based on your current astronomy setup (telescope, eyepiece and/or camera). The application is loosely based on the [astronomy.tools](https://astronomy.tools/calculators/field_of_view/) web service.
